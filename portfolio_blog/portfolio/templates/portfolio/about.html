Due to the mix of ideas I had, I decided that it would be a good place to actually create an official webpage out of this one and implement even more functionalities.<br><br> I wanted to write articles to help others learn, I had an idea connecting fetching of new published articles of my followed resources of learning, also also I wanted to share my portfolio projects that would be shared along with my CV. <br><br>So I decided to make it an all-in-one. It is, helping others, easily finding the source code of articles, if you like my articles and projects, you can directly see them on my github and also see what resources I am following and recommending to learn programming with. Enjoy everything you find here!</code></p>
