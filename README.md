## Code quality

I've done the best to my ability to write clean, understandable code following some of the SOLID principles, the PEP8 style guide. 

You can find some of those here too :)

## Rules

> **Note**: **Please do your best following the rules:**

1. This is open source, feel free to copy and **use** this code, to modify, play around, learn and create your own portfolio basing on this!
2. Please do not use with just exchanging the data.

Following a pre-made code is fine, but the most learning comes from practice and modification, own usage of the functionality or design we want to achieve!
